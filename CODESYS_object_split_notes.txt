4) Create FB_SlmpReadDevice
- FB: FB_SlmpReadDevice
  source: src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpReadDevice.st

4.1) Create FB_SlmpReadPlcInfo
- FB: FB_SlmpReadPlcInfo
  source: src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpReadPlcInfo.st

4.2) Create FB_SlmpCloseConnection
- FB: FB_SlmpCloseConnection
  source: src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpCloseConnection.st

5) Create FB_SlmpWriteDevice
- FB: FB_SlmpWriteDevice
  source: src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpWriteDevice.st
- Methods under FB_SlmpWriteDevice:
  - BuildWritePayload (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpWriteDevice.BuildWritePayload.st)
  - BuildBitPayload   (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpWriteDevice.BuildBitPayload.st)
  - BuildWordPayload  (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpWriteDevice.BuildWordPayload.st)

6) Create FB_SlmpService
- FB: FB_SlmpService
  source: src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.st
- Methods under FB_SlmpService:
  - ReadWord  (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.ReadWord.st)
  - ReadBit   (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.ReadBit.st)
  - WriteWord (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.WriteWord.st)
  - WriteBit  (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.WriteBit.st)
  - ReadPlcInfo (src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpService.ReadPlcInfo.st)

7) Create sample program
- PLC_PRG
  source: src/PLC_PRG_Example.st

8) Important checks
- Legacy objects are not used in this structure:
  FB_SlmpReadDWord / FB_SlmpWriteDWord
  (remove them from project to avoid ambiguous type/name errors)
- Object name and declaration name must match exactly.
- Keep method names exactly as listed above.

9) Implementation marker rule
- Insert `// === IMPLEMENTATION ===` between declaration and implementation.
- If a file has `END_VAR`, place the marker immediately after `END_VAR`.
- If a file has `END_TYPE`, do not insert the marker.
- If a file has no `END_VAR` (for example simple function/method body style), place the marker near the top (after signature line).
- Keep this marker style unified across all `src/SLMP_Function/*.st` and `src/PLC_PRG_Example.st`.

10) Bit order consistency
- Bit write payload order and bit read decode order are paired implementation.
- If changing nibble/bit ordering, update both files together:
  - `src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpWriteDevice.BuildBitPayload.st`
  - `src/SLMP_Function/FB_SlmpReadDevice.DecodeBitArray.st`
